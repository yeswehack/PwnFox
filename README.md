## Features

![popup](/screenshots/popup.png)

### Single click BurpProxy

Connect to Burp with a simple click, this will probably remove the need for other addons like foxyProxy. However if you need the extra features provided by foxyProxy you can leave this unchecked. 

###  Containers Profiles

PwnFox give you fast access to the Firefox containers. This allow you to have multiple identities in the same browser. 
When PwnFox and the `Add container header` option are enabled, PwnFox will automatically add a `X-PwnFox-Color` header to hightlight the query in Burp.

PwnFoxBurp will automatically highlight and strip the header, but you can also specify your own behavior with addons like logger++.

You can also provide your own function to parse/filter the messages.
You get access to 3 arguments:
 * data -> the message data
 * origin -> the window object representing the origin
 * destion -> the window object representing the destination

You can return a string or a JSON serializable object.

### Toolbox

Inject you own javascript code on page load. The code will be loaded as soon as possible. This can used to add dangerous behavior detection, or just to add extra function to your js console.

**Be carefull, the injected toolbox will run in the window context. Do not inject secret in untrusted domain.**
